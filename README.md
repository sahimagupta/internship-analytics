## 📖 The Story Behind This Project

India's **Ministry of Women & Child Development (WCD)** runs an internship programme designed to provide hands on policy experience to young women across the country. Every cycle, hundreds of women students, scholars, teachers, and social activists apply for a chance to work within the Ministry and contribute to India's social welfare agenda.

This project analyzes **478 female internship applications** from the Feb-Mar intake cycle, spanning **28 Indian states** and **6 geographic zones**. The goal is to understand **who these women are** where they come from, what they study, how they perform academically, and what support they need.

The findings reveal fascinating patterns about **women's participation in government programmes**, the **rural-urban divide**, and the **educational landscape** of India's aspiring policy professionals.
